# Social Distance Analyzer using deep learning and CV
A social distance analyzer is a device or software that uses various technologies, such as cameras, sensors, or machine learning algorithms, to detect and measure the distance between individuals in a given area. This can be used to enforce social distancing guidelines in public spaces, such as offices, schools, and other crowded areas, in order to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. It can also be used to alert individuals if they are too close to each other.
